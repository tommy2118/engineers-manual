# Reading Routes

> This is a field manual, not a textbook. You don't read it cover to cover. You use it when you need it.

## A Note on Framing

This manual uses military metaphors throughout. The intent is operational: the voice in your ear when things are going sideways, practical guidance under pressure.

If the framing doesn't resonate, ignore it. Take what helps. Leave what doesn't. The principles underneath are what matter.

## How to Use This Manual

**When you have a specific question:** Use search (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K) or the table of contents. Find the section. Get the answer. Get back to work.

**When you want to learn a topic:** Read the relevant chapter. Follow the cross-references. Apply what you learn immediately.

**When you're mentoring:** Point to specific sections. Use the checklists. Reference shared vocabulary.

**When you're debating:** Ground the discussion in the frameworks. "What level of work is this?" "What are we trading off?" "Is this architecture or design?"

## Routes by Role

### New Engineer (First Week)

Start here. Build the foundation.

1. **[Master Your Gear](/01-foundations/01-master-your-gear/)** — Know your tools. This is non-negotiable.
2. **[Find Your Own Answers](/01-foundations/02-find-your-own-answers/)** — The hierarchy of truth. The 15-minute rule.
3. **[Code Review](/03-working-with-others/11-code-review/)** — How we review. How to receive feedback.
4. **[Pairing & Collaboration](/03-working-with-others/12-pairing/)** — How we work together.

Then explore as needed. The rest will come.

### On-Call Engineer

When you're carrying the pager.

1. **[Debugging](/04-when-things-go-wrong/13-debugging/)** — The methodology. Reproduce, isolate, understand, fix, verify.
2. **[Incidents](/04-when-things-go-wrong/14-incidents/)** — Roles, priorities, communication cadence.
3. **[Quick Reference: Debugging](/appendices/quick-ref-debugging/)** — The checklist version.
4. **[Templates](/appendices/templates/)** — Incident update and postmortem skeletons.

Bookmark these. You'll need them at 2 AM.

### Tech Lead

Architecture, debt, and people.

1. **[Architecture vs Design](/02-the-work/08-architecture-vs-design/)** — Know what's load-bearing. Choose tradeoffs deliberately.
2. **[Technical Debt](/04-when-things-go-wrong/15-technical-debt/)** — Deliberate debt. Debt registers. Payback triggers.
3. **[Communication](/03-working-with-others/10-communication/)** — Status, decisions, alignment.
4. **[P-Cubed](/02-the-work/07-p-cubed/)** — Prepare, Prove, Produce. The execution cycle.

You're making architectural decisions and helping others grow. These are your tools.

---

### Staff+ / Principal

Systems thinking and organizational impact.

1. **[Levels of Work](/02-the-work/06-levels-of-work/)** — Problem, Initiative, Epic, Task. Know which you're solving.
2. **[Architecture vs Design](/02-the-work/08-architecture-vs-design/)** — There are no best practices. Only tradeoffs.
3. **[Teaching & Mentoring](/05-the-long-game/17-teaching/)** — Multiplying yourself.
4. **[The Canon](/appendices/the-canon/)** — The reading list. The shared vocabulary.

You're shaping how others work. These frameworks become your vocabulary.

---

### Manager / Engineering Leader

People, process, and systems.

1. **[Communication](/03-working-with-others/10-communication/)** — Status updates, decision-making, alignment.
2. **[P-Cubed](/02-the-work/07-p-cubed/)** — How work flows through teams.
3. **[Incidents](/04-when-things-go-wrong/14-incidents/)** — Response structure. Postmortems. Blameless culture.
4. **[Learning & Growth](/05-the-long-game/16-learning/)** — How engineers develop.

You're creating the environment where good engineering happens.
