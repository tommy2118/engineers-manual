## Levels of Work

**Problem**: An undefined challenge to solve. No clear solution yet. Requires discovery to define what success looks like.

**Initiative**: A defined objective that solves a Problem. Weeks or months of work. Decomposes into Epics.

**Epic**: A major phase of an Initiative. Delivers a meaningful milestone. Runs through P-Cubed. Produces Tasks.

**Task**: A specific action. 1-2 days of focused work. Clear acceptance criteria.

---

## P-Cubed

**P-Cubed**: Prepare → Prove → Produce. The cycle for executing an Epic.

**Prepare**: The phase where you build understanding, surface tradeoffs, and plan the work.

**Prove**: The phase where you validate load-bearing decisions before committing.

**Produce**: The phase where you execute tasks, verify against criteria, and ship.

**Discovery**: The sub-phase of Prepare where you explore the problem space, ask questions, and build understanding.

**Spike**: A time-boxed experiment to validate a technical assumption or approach.

---

## Architecture & Design

**Load-Bearing**: A decision that's hard to change after you build on top of it. Requires extra rigor upfront.

**Architecture**: The structural decisions in a system. Database schema, service boundaries, core abstractions. Hard to change.

**Design**: The surface decisions in a system. API shape, UI components, implementation details. Easier to change.

**Tradeoff**: What you give up when you choose one approach over another. There's no free lunch.

---

## Practices

**TDD**: Test-Driven Development. Write the test first, then implement to make it pass.

**GOOS**: Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests. Outside-in, mockist-style TDD.

**Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches, frequent integration to main. Every commit is deployable.

---

## General

**Done**: The acceptance criteria are met. Not "feels done." Criteria met.

**Acceptance Criteria**: The specific, checkable conditions that define when a Task is complete.

**Mental Model**: Your internal representation of how a system works. How you predict behavior.
