## Identify What You Have

| Level | Size | Your Job |
|-------|------|----------|
| Problem | Undefined | Discovery → Define Initiative |
| Initiative | Weeks/Months | Decompose → Define Epics |
| Epic | Days/Weeks | P-Cubed → Produce Tasks |
| Task | 1-2 Days | Execute → Ship |

---

## The Phases

### Prepare

**Discovery:**
- Ask questions
- Track unknowns explicitly
- Talk to people with context

**Exit when:** Can explain it clearly, no more surprises, questions resolved.

**Surface tradeoffs:**
- What does each option optimize for?
- What are we giving up?
- What's the cost to change later?

**Planning:**
- Break into Tasks (1-2 days each)
- Write: "This is done when ___."
- Sequence architectural work first

---

### Prove

**Required for architectural decisions. Optional for design.**

- Spike the riskiest assumption
- Validate tradeoffs in practice
- Refine the plan

**Exit when:** Major risks tested, approach survives scrutiny, ready to commit.

---

### Produce

**For each Task:**
1. Build — Do the work
2. Test — Verify against criteria
3. Ship — Complete, communicate, move on

**After each Task:**
- What did you learn?
- Adjust remaining plan if needed

## The Checklist

Before you start:
- [ ] What level is this?
- [ ] What does done look like? (Written down)
- [ ] What's load-bearing?

Before you build:
- [ ] Tradeoffs documented
- [ ] Architectural risks spiked
- [ ] Tasks scoped to 1-2 days

Before you ship:
- [ ] Criteria met (check the definition, not your feelings)
- [ ] Communicated to stakeholders

## The Mantra

**Define done before you start.**
**Check criteria, not feelings.**
**Ship when done means done.**
