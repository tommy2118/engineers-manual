## The Pattern That Follows You

You have a way of approaching problems. A pattern. It's been with you longer than you realize.

The way you debug code is the way you troubleshoot a car. The way you plan a project is the way you plan a trip. The way you learn a new framework is the way you learn anything.

This pattern transferred from domain to domain before you were an engineer. It will follow you to whatever comes next.

**Know your pattern.** It's your most valuable asset and your most persistent liability.

## Model-Builders vs. Fast Executors

Some people receive a briefing and start executing immediately. They trust the information, accept the constraints, and move. Fast. Efficient. Decisive.

Others need to build their own mental model first. They poke at the problem. Test hypotheses. Be wrong a few times. Only then do they move, but when they move, they move with understanding.

Neither is better. Both have costs.

**Fast executors** risk building on shaky foundations. They might ship something that works but doesn't fit. They might solve the wrong problem efficiently.

**Model-builders** risk spinning too long. Analysis paralysis. Waiting for certainty that will never come. Perfecting the plan while the window closes.

Which are you? Not which do you want to be. Which are you actually, when you're tired, when you're pressured, when no one's watching?

## Your Failure Mode

Everyone has a default failure mode. The thing that goes wrong when things go wrong.

**Ship too fast:** You skip preparation. You don't fully understand the problem before you start solving it. You ship, then discover you built the wrong thing. Your PRs get sent back. You create more work than you save.

**Ship too slow:** You can't define done, so you never get there. You're waiting for confidence that won't come. You over-prepare, over-research, over-think. The work expands to fill whatever time is available.

**Oscillate:** You swing between the two. Ship too fast, get burned, over-correct to shipping too slow. Then miss a deadline, panic, ship too fast again. The pendulum never settles.

**The common thread:** You're checking feelings instead of criteria. "Does this feel done?" is the wrong question. "Does this meet the acceptance criteria?" is the right one.

---

## The Feelings Trap

Feelings lie.

When you're excited about a solution, it feels done. It isn't. You're high on the dopamine of solving the puzzle. You haven't checked if it actually works.

When you're uncertain about a solution, it feels not done. It might be. Uncertainty is not evidence of incompleteness. Sometimes the uncertainty is just... uncertainty.

**The fix:** Define done before you start. Write it down. One sentence. "This is done when ___."

Then check the criteria, not your feelings. Does it meet the criteria? Ship it. Does it not? Keep working. Your feelings are not invited to this decision.

## Permission to Work Your Way

Here's something that took too long to learn: you're allowed to work the way you work.

If you need to build a mental model before you can execute, that's not a weakness to fix. That's how you work. Build the model. Just don't let it become an excuse for not shipping.

If you work in bursts, with intense focus followed by recovery, that's not a discipline problem. That's how you work. Arrange your schedule around it instead of fighting it.

If you think by talking, find someone to talk to. If you think by writing, write first. If you need to see the code before you can design, write the code first.

**The caveat:** Understanding your pattern is not permission to skip the work. Model-builders still have to ship. Fast executors still have to prepare. You work with your pattern, not as its hostage.

## Building Self-Awareness

Self-awareness isn't natural. It's built.

**After each project:**
- What went well? What patterns led to that?
- What didn't go well? What patterns led to that?
- Did I ship too fast, too slow, or about right?
- What would I do differently?

**Watch for triggers:**
- What makes you skip preparation?
- What makes you over-prepare?
- When do you check feelings instead of criteria?
- What kind of feedback do you resist hearing?

**Ask others:**
- "What's it like to work with me?"
- "Where do you see me getting stuck?"
- "What would you change about how we collaborate?"

Then listen. Actually listen. Don't defend. Don't explain. Take notes. Sit with it.

## Your Failure Mode Guardrails

Once you know your failure mode, build guardrails.

**If you ship too fast:**
- Force yourself to write down what done looks like before starting
- Add a review step. Not optional. Required.
- When you feel the urge to ship, pause. Check criteria.
- Ask: "What would a 10-minute preparation have caught?"

**If you ship too slow:**
- Timebox discovery. When the box ends, start building.
- Define "good enough" explicitly. Write it down.
- Ship earlier than comfortable. Learn from production.
- Ask: "What's the cost of waiting another day?"

**If you oscillate:**
- Notice which mode you're in right now
- Check criteria, not feelings
- Create a checklist for "ready to ship"
- Use it. Every time. No exceptions.

The guardrails don't fix the pattern. They manage it. You're not trying to become a different person. You're trying to catch yourself before the pattern causes damage.

## The Pattern Across Domains

That aircraft maintainer troubleshooting a hydraulic failure is using the same pattern they'll use debugging code. Gather information. Form hypotheses. Test. Isolate. Fix. Verify.

That recruiter matching candidates to roles is using the same pattern they'll use in system design. Understand requirements. Understand options. Find the fit. Manage tradeoffs.

The domain changes. The tools change. The pattern doesn't.

This is why you can move between industries, between languages, between paradigms. The specific knowledge is learnable. The pattern is transferable.

It's also why your failure mode follows you. It doesn't care what language you're writing. It doesn't care what industry you're in. It's yours.

## The Work of Knowing Yourself

Knowing yourself is not a one-time revelation. It's ongoing work.

You'll discover new patterns. You'll find failure modes you didn't know you had. You'll think you've fixed something, only to watch it resurface under pressure.

This is normal. This is the work.

The goal isn't to become someone without patterns or failure modes. The goal is to know them well enough to work with them. To catch them before they catch you.

**Know your pattern.** It's been with you your whole life. It will be with you for the rest of it. You might as well understand it.

*Your pattern follows you. Your failure modes follow you. The question isn't whether they exist; it's whether you know them well enough to manage them.*
