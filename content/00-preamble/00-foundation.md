## Why This Exists

This is a decade in tech, reinforced by two decades of military experience, distilled into a field manual. Not theory. Tactics. The kind of guidance that helps you bootstrap, calibrate, and stay out of ditches you don't need to visit yourself.

A lasting mentor. Something this old MSgt can be proud of.

Use it like a reference. Start where you are. Skip what you already know. Come back when you're stuck or when the stakes are high.

## On Calibration

Worry about the things that smart people worry about.

Smart people. Curious. Well-read. Good at vetting sources. Calm under pressure.

If someone you've calibrated as sharp gets cautious, take the hint. The questioning happened earlier, when you were deciding who to watch. Once that's done, trust it. Move when they move.

Calibrate on outcomes over time, especially under pressure.

---

## On Feedback

Find someone who knows you well enough to be your calibration source.

Not someone who makes excuses for you. Someone who expects your full output, whatever that is that day. Not 100%. That's not real. The best you've got, consistently.

Your self-assessment is noisy. A calibrated outside source gives you signal.

---

## On Orientation

I've always known the type of person I want to be. I haven't always lived up to it, but I've always known.

The gap between knowing and living isn't failure. It's the whole game. The people who scare me are the ones who think they've arrived.

Name what you're aiming at. Accept you'll fall short. Keep orienting anyway.

## The Triptych

These three things hold together:

**Calibration** tells you who to trust: who's earned the right to move you without explanation in the moment.

**Feedback** tells you who can tell you the truth: who's done the work to know you and still expects your best.

**Orientation** tells you what you're aiming at: the person you've always known you wanted to be, even when you fall short.

Get these right and you have a foundation. Everything else in this manual is tactics. This is the why.
