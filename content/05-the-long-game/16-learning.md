## Building Mental Models

A mental model is how you understand a system. It's your internal representation of how things work.

**Strong mental models:**
- Let you predict system behavior
- Help you debug faster
- Enable better architectural decisions
- Transfer across domains

**How to build them:**
- Poke at systems. See what happens.
- Explain things to others. Teaching reveals gaps.
- Read source code. Don't just use abstractions—understand them.
- Ask "why" repeatedly. Get to root causes.

---

## Retrospectives

After any significant work:

- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What did I learn?
- What will I do differently next time?

**Write it down.** Your future self is a stranger.

## Compounding Knowledge

Knowledge compounds. Each thing you learn makes the next thing easier to learn.

- Fundamentals matter most. They apply everywhere.
- Patterns repeat across domains.
- The more models you have, the faster you build new ones.

---

## Learning From Experience

Experience alone isn't enough. Reflection turns experience into learning.

- You solved the problem. Why did your approach work?
- You got stuck. What assumption was wrong?
- You made a mistake. What would you do differently?

**The introspection loop:** Experience → Reflect → Extract → Apply
