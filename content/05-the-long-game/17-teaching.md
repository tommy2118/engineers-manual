## Mentoring Others

**As steel sharpens steel.** The veterans have wisdom. You're becoming a veteran. Pass it on.

- Share what you've learned
- Be patient with those learning
- Remember what it was like to not know
- Create space for questions

**Good mentoring:**
- Asks questions instead of giving answers
- Lets people struggle (productively)
- Provides safety to fail
- Shares the "why" not just the "what"

---

## Writing Documentation

- Write for the person who comes after you
- Assume they have no context
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Keep it updated or delete it

**The test:** Could someone new understand this without talking to you?

---

## Leaving Breadcrumbs

Your future self is a stranger. Your teammates are strangers. Leave trails.

- Commit messages that explain intent
- Comments that explain "why" (not "what")
- READMEs that actually help
- Decision records for architectural choices

---

## The Obligation to Share

You didn't learn alone. Others invested in you. Pay it forward.

- Share knowledge openly
- Make time for questions
- Write things down for others to find
- Build systems that teach
