## What Is Technical Debt

The implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.

**Not all debt is bad.** Sometimes you take on debt deliberately to ship faster. The problem is unmanaged debt that compounds.

---

## Recognizing It

Signs of technical debt:

- "Don't touch that, it'll break"
- Changes that should be simple take days
- Fear of modifying certain areas
- Copy-paste instead of abstraction
- Tests that are slow, flaky, or missing
- Tribal knowledge required to operate

---

## Paying It Down

- **Make it visible.** Track it. Don't let it hide.
- **Pay interest.** Small improvements alongside feature work.
- **Pay principal.** Dedicated time to address larger issues.
- **Prioritize by impact.** What debt is costing you the most?

---

## Living With It

You can't eliminate all debt. You manage it.

- Know where the debt is
- Know what it's costing you
- Make deliberate choices about when to pay it down
- Don't let it block critical work

---

## Deliberate Debt

Sometimes taking on debt is the right call:

- Time-sensitive opportunity
- Learning/discovery phase
- Throwaway code (that actually gets thrown away)

**The key:** Make it deliberate. Know you're taking on debt. Plan to pay it back.
